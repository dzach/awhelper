# awhelper
A tcl script for some common tasks for AndroWish: http://www.androwish.org/index.html/home

Provides a dialog with the following options:
1. Create a home screen shortcut
   - Select target TCL script
   - Select optional icon for the shortcut
   - Enter an optional name for the shortcut
2. Edit and install .wishrc in the HOME directory of an Android device
   - The .wishrc script is autoloaded whenever the AndroWish binary is run.
   - The simple editor provides text cursor navigation buttons to make editing on a phone a little easier.
 
 Here is how it looks:
